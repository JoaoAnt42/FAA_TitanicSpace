## Abstract
A predictive analyses of four different models were performed in the scope of a Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic". The specific purpose of this study is to evaluate which passengers where Transported based on some initial conditions /features. This features were scraped from the damaged computer, resulting in around one forth of the passengers have at least one not a number (Nan) in their features.

Using minimal hyper parameter search, we have reached the top 7\% of the leaderboard, place number 167 at the time of writing this.

## Original Description
> Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.
>
> The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.
>
> While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!
>
> To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
>
> Help save them and change history!
